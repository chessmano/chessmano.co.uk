One time it was a boy with glasses and a head full of thick copper.<br>
curls. Another time it was a boy with black eyes and no hair at<br> 
all. Sometimes I'm black, sometimes white, sometimes olive or brown<br>
or yellow or red or whatever else they can think of. In other words,<br> 
the Republic has no idea what I look like. They don't seem to<br> 
know much of anything about me, except that I'm young<br> 
and that when they run my fingerprints they don't find a<br> 
match in their databases. That's why  they hate me, why l'm<br>
not the most dangerous criminal in the country, but the most<br> 
wanted. I make  them look bad. It's early evening, but it's<br> 
already pitch-black outside, and the JumboTrons' reflections<br> 
are visible in the street's puddles. I sit on a crumbling<br>
window ledge three stories up, hidden from view behind rusted<br>
steel beams. This used to be an apartment complex, but it's<br> 
fallen into disrepair. Broken lanterns and glass shards litter<br>
the floor of this room, and paint is peeling from every wall.<br>
In one cor-ner, an old portrait of the Elector Primo lies<br>
faceup on the ground. I wonder who used to live here-no one's<br>
cracked enough to let their portrait of the Elector sit<br> 
discarded on the floor like that. My hair, as usual, is tucked<br> 
inside an old newsboy cap. My eyes are fixed on the small one-story<br> 
house across the road. My hands fiddle with the pendant tied<br> 
around my neck. Tess leans against the room's other window, watching<br>
me closely. I'm restless tonight and, as always, she can sense it.<br> 
The plague has hit the Lake sector hard. In the glow of the<br>
JumboTrons, Tess and I can see the soldiers at the end of the<br>
street as they inspect each home, their black capes shiny and<br> 
worn loose</p>
